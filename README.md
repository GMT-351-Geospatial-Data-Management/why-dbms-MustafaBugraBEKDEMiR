#Advantage of DBMS over file system Few of them are as follows: 
No redundant data: Redundancy removed by data normalization. 
No data duplication saves storage and improves access time. 
Data Security: It is easier to apply access constraints in database systems so that only authorized user is able to access the data.
If all the data is centrally stored in a well designed database then there would be no duplicated data and data is always consistent. 
Another less obvious benefit is that the Excel workbooks can be better controlled because data is now decoupled from the Excel workbook.
